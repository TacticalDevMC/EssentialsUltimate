# If you receive an error when EssentialsUltimate loads, ensure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks
